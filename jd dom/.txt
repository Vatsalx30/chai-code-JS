📌 Step 1: Plan the Features

Decide what functionalities your to-do app should have. Some basic and advanced features:

✅ Basic Features:
	•	Add a new task
	•	Display the task list
	•	Mark a task as completed
	•	Delete a task

🚀 Advanced Features (Optional for later):
	•	Edit tasks
	•	Filter tasks (All, Completed, Pending)
	•	Save tasks to localStorage (for persistence)
	•	Set task deadlines with reminders

⸻

📋 Step 2: Structure with HTML

Create a simple HTML layout:
	1.	Input field – To type new tasks.
	2.	Add button – To add tasks to the list.
	3.	Task list – A section where tasks will be displayed.

👉 Example layout:
	•	Header: “My To-Do List”
	•	Input: <input type="text"> for task entry
	•	Button: “Add Task”
	•	<ul>: For listing tasks dynamically

🎨 Step 3: Style with CSS

Focus on clean UI:
	1.	Design the task input and add button.
	2.	Style tasks with checkboxes for completion.
	3.	Use CSS classes to show completed tasks (e.g., strike-through text).
	4.	Make it responsive (optional).

🧠 Step 4: Functional Logic with JavaScript

Here’s how to think about the logic:
	1.	Select Elements:
	•	Get the input, button, and task list using document.querySelector().
	2.	Add a Task:
	•	Capture the input value when clicking “Add Task.”
	•	Create a new <li> element with:
	•	Task text
	•	Checkbox (for completion)
	•	Delete button
	3.	Mark as Completed:
	•	Toggle a CSS class (e.g., .completed) when the checkbox is clicked.
	4.	Delete a Task:
	•	Remove the parent <li> when clicking the delete button.

⸻

📂 Step 5: Enhance with Advanced Features (Optional)
	1.	Save Tasks in localStorage:
	•	Save the task list when adding, deleting, or marking tasks.
	•	Load saved tasks on page reload.
	2.	Edit Tasks:
	•	Allow users to double-click and modify a task.
	3.	Filter Tasks:
	•	Add buttons to filter “All”, “Completed”, and “Pending.”

🧪 Step 6: Test & Iterate
	1.	Test every feature after implementing.
	2.	Debug errors using console.log() and DevTools.
	3.	Improve UI and performance iteratively.
